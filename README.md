The website was created to bring all things related to Travis Scott into one website. The website links to Travis Scott merch, vinyl, and tickets for his upcoming tour. My website aims to allow fans of Travis Scott to buy his merch without the hassle of visiting many different websites. Everything the user wants related to Travis Scott can be easily found. It is also to promote Travis Scott's merch, tour and introduce Travis Scott to more people.
## Design Process
The Website is designed to have a good user experience with good functionality. As most of Travis Scott’s fans are teenagers and young adults, the website needs to be appealing to them, having a minimalistic design with few words and more pictures. The websites should also have a simple color palette, following the color palette associated with Travis Scott, Brown, White, and Black.
